Jerome Shaw

Occupation: Government

Activities: 
4-wheeling on the abundance of off-road trail systems in Washington State, hiking, fishing, sporting events, and volunteering at Veteran non-profits in the PNW.

Other Details:

Jerome Shaw's journey is one of transition. While stationed at Camp Murray, he discovered his love for outdoor activities in the PNW. Since leaving the National Guard, he has been busy building up his Jeep for off-roading and is now searching for a new furry companion to join his new hobby. His story resonates with many who have experienced similar life changes.
Jerome purchased a new Mac this year after turning in his government laptop. He uses his 2-year-old smartphone most of the time to search for a new dog to join him on the trails and to download the trails routed from Trails Offroad.
